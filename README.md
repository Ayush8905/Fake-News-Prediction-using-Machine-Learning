📰 Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project is a Machine Learning model built to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is trained on a Kaggle dataset to help combat misinformation by identifying unreliable news sources.

📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing labeled news articles. It includes two categories:

Fake News (misleading or false information)
Real News (verified and legitimate information)
🔗 Dataset Link: Fake News Dataset on Kaggle (Add the actual dataset link here)

🔧 Features
✔ Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization (TF-IDF).
✔ Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and more.
✔ Accuracy Optimization: Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
✔ Google Colab Support: Run the model easily without local setup.

🚀 Installation & Usage
🛠 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
Required Python libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
📌 Steps to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fake-News-Prediction.git
cd Fake-News-Prediction
2️⃣ Download the Dataset
Place the dataset in the project folder (or update the path in the code).

3️⃣ Run the Notebook
Open Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Run all cells to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
4️⃣ Predict Fake News
Use the trained model to predict whether a given article is real or fake.

📊 Model Performance
The model was tested using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.

📈 Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression
✅ Accuracy: XX% (Replace with your model's accuracy)

💡 Future Improvements
🔹 Deploy the model using Flask/Django for a web-based fake news detection system.
🔹 Integrate a deep learning-based approach (LSTM, BERT).
🔹 Build a real-time news validation API.
